**Linux Philosophy:**

-Linux assumes the user is competent and computer-literate.
-The terminal can be accessed via multiple methods, and it's easy to do.
-Linux grants complete control and does not prompt the user if they are sure of actions.

**Virtual Private Server**

- A virtual private server is a computer and operating system partition that is stored on a physical computer other than your own, but set up online and can be managed/accessed online.

*Advantages*

- A VPS is advantageous as a weakly secured server will not be as disastrous compared to storing the server on your private computer with other private data.
- Cheaper than than a fully dedicated hosting plan.
- More control such as root access.


Running programs in Linux as the root user is dangerous as the root user has full access (admin) to all of the core files and OS. So, a virus/malware or bug that is caught while running the root has the potential to destroy the computer at the OS level.
