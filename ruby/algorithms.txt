For a personal robot standing in an elevator:
- Recall that we live on the 44th floor.
- Position your vision sensors until you capture the panel of buttons in view.
- Position your chassis towards the panel of buttons.
- Focus your vision sensors on the button labeled "44".
- Raise your pointing apparatus until it is hovering in front of the button labeled "44".
- Move your pointing apparatus forward until it makes contact with the button labeled "44".
- Move your pointing apparatus forward another 1/4 inch to press and activate the button.
    - if the elevator is occupied by another passenger, ask if they would like you to press their floor.
        - if they agree and give their floor number, repeat the previous steps used to press "44", but for their floor number.
            - then wait for the elevator doors to close and for the elevator to move upwards.
        - else, wait for the elevator doors to close and for the elevator to move upwards.
- Position your viewing sensor to view the elevator's display.
- Until the display shows "44", wait inside the elevator.
- When the display shows "44" you have reached our home floor.
- When the elevator doors reopen at "44", proceed straight until you reach the end of the hall and the door labeled "44A".
