# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
- Version control is useful because it allows one to record changes to a file overtime, allowing one to recall specific versions to see the changes.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
- A branch is one of the key features of version control and allows the user to mark a fork in the master file and make changes that can either remain separate or be merged to the master file at a later date. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* What is a merge conflict?
- A commit is the recording of a change to the repository. A good commit message clearly defines which changes were made.
* What is a merge conflict?
- A merge conflict occurs when git is unclear of how to merge the branches properly. For example, when two users try to modify and update the same line of code a merge conflict will.
